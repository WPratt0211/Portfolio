# Portfolio

This project was done in order to practice and implement the skills that I have developed so far in HTML5 and CSS3, while also practicing with the structure of a portfolio site.
The project is intended to be used as a portfolio site when finished.
I plan to implement many more styling features to this site to make it more visually admirable, as well as more interactive with the user.
